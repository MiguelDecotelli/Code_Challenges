1. I'm passioned and devoted to who believes in me and values what I can contribute to so giving allowing me this opportunity will guarantee a hard working employee that will be willing to give everything to thrive and achieve the best results possible. Completing some of Harvard's CS50 courses gave me solid foundations to face all sorts of problems and surpass almost any challenges.

2. After a substantial period working with sales, leading teams and being recognize by customers as an example of competence, I started to work with software development and feeling extremely blessed to take this decision.
My last position (Python Developer) was to create a web application that connected with a SQL database and managed car rentals for a small company (remotely) from NY. Along with Python Flask and PostgreSQL I've created a solid and clean version of the company's web application that granted a great UI and UX (administrators), using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Moreover I'm familiar with Angular framework that gave me more versatility to create SPA with ease.

3. I think overall all my work, projects and challenges have a significant role on my evolution as a software engineer but if I need to pick one, I would say to figure out the programming logic behind a few features I added on the car rental database that could be easily applied to other scenarios. As I see it, good foundations allow you to solidify your knowledge for all sorts of situations.

4. First I would try to understand why the solution I presented wasn't suffice, then I would try to implement the proposed corrections to see if they would generate an improved version of my work. If it does, then I would happily adjust and credit the responsible for the upgrade.

5. Since I do not want to start this relationship with a lie, I must say the time I heard these two terms was today, applying to this job position.
Although as I worked with sales before I could say I had my fare share of online marketing with tools such as email, content and social media marketing. I'm also familiar with influencer marketing and google ads.

6. Since I mentioned it before I will attend myself to list the tech stacks:
- Python
- Flask
- PoostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Git
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- Javascript and Typescript
- Angular
- AWS in general
- Agile Methodology
- IaC
Regarding to CMS and SysAdmin, I'm yet to have a field experience with it.

 Question: Make a short video introduction of yourself. VIDEO (3-5 minutes):

	Hello, my name is Miguel and I am a software developer with almost 2 years of experience in the field. At the end of February I acquired my CS50 - Introduction to programming with python Certificate - It's an online course from Harvard's University which I consider to be one of the greatests accomplishments I had as a self-educated individual. Should not be taken for granted that I'm self-taught on english language during my childhood as well.

	Before entering on this field, I had a successfull tenure as a sales representative, working as a team leader, as the company's liason and also directly with customers and clients. But the decision to change venues came unexpectedly through a friend's advice which I'm extremely glad it did came because I found a passion that I did not know I had before.

	My current set of skills includes Python, Flask, web development, Angular, AWS, IaC and SQL databases. But I ain't stopping there because I wanna keep honing my skills while I can learn something new on every opportunity I come accross. So I won't shut myself down from exploring new technologies if there's a project that I feel interested in being a part off, even if I'm not a perfect fit right from the beginning.

	I also believe that a certain level of excelence from a company is reached when the individuals that work there are engaged with it's goals and understand their purpose!

	Now speaking about the excitement to work with CoTech, it would be remarkable to work on a cutting edge company with such high standards and so many incredibles milestones collected already. And even being on a remote position, I found the office so coasy and friendly that it probably means that the team is really great to be work with. But to imagine that I could be adding my share of work to contribute with part of it makes me really wish to be selected for this position and be able to develop and deliver significant results to our clients.

	I'm always looking to succeed and deliver everything I have to be a valuabled member to the team. I'm bright, creative and very proactive. Intagibles that cannot be measured by years but by the amount of results I can provide. With the right incetive and motivation I can be as great as the company can be. It has been this way everywhere I worked before. And it definetly won't be different on Coalition technologies, specially at this stage of my career that I want to excell and be part of something really meaningfull.
